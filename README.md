# parrot-post-phishing-analysis
Project Overview

This repository documents a phishing email analysis exercise based on the Parrot Post scenario. The objective of this project is to identify, analyze, and document social engineering techniques used in a phishing email by examining both human-centric cues and technical email artifacts.

The exercise simulates a real-world phishing attack where an attacker impersonates a delivery service to trick users into clicking malicious links and submitting sensitive information.

🎯 Objectives

Identify phishing indicators in a suspicious email

Analyze email headers to determine message origin and authenticity

Inspect embedded links without interacting with malicious content

Identify the type of phishing attack and social engineering techniques used

Document findings in a professional cybersecurity report format

🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

Email header analysis

URL inspection (hover analysis)

Web browser (safe, non-interactive analysis)

Cybersecurity training platform


🧪 Methodology

Reviewed the phishing email content for urgency, tone, and impersonation indicators

Verified sender identity and analyzed mismatched email domains

Examined email headers to identify spoofing and authentication failures

Inspected suspicious URLs without clicking or submitting data

Identified the phishing attack type and extracted required flags
