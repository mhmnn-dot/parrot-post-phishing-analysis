Step 1: Initial Email Inspection

The exercise begins with a received email claiming to be from Parrot Post, informing the recipient about a delivery issue that requires urgent action.

Key observations:

The email creates urgency by stating the parcel cannot be delivered.

The message encourages the user to click a link to “reschedule delivery” or “confirm details”.

The branding and tone attempt to mimic a legitimate postal service.

Step 2: Sender Address Analysis

Upon inspecting the sender’s email address:

The display name appears legitimate (e.g., Parrot Post Support).

However, the actual email domain does not match an official Parrot Post domain.

This mismatch is a common phishing tactic to exploit user trust.

Flag Identified:
 Phishing Indicator – Spoofed sender domain

Step 3: Email Header Analysis

Next, the email headers were examined to identify technical red flags.

Findings:

The Return-Path and Received fields show the email originated from an untrusted or unrelated mail server.

SPF/DKIM results either failed or were missing, indicating the sender is not authorized.

IP addresses do not resolve to official Parrot Post infrastructure.

Flag Identified:
 Malicious origin identified in email headers

Step 4: Link Inspection

Without clicking the link:

Hovering over the embedded URL revealed a suspicious domain.

The link does not point to an official Parrot Post website.

The URL structure appears obfuscated or shortened to hide its destination.

Example characteristics:

Random characters in domain name

Use of HTTP instead of HTTPS

Misspelled or misleading domain (typosquatting)

Flag Identified:
 Malicious phishing URL


Step 5: Phishing Website Analysis (Non-Interactive)

The phishing page was viewed without submitting any information.

Observations:

The site requests personal information such as name, address, or payment details.

Poor grammar and inconsistent branding were present.

No valid SSL certificate or improper HTTPS configuration.

This confirms the email’s intent is to steal sensitive user information.

Flag Identified:
 Credential harvesting phishing page
